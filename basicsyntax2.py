"""
Progam 2 of Ynon Perek's NonTrivial Python,
program takes a file name as command line argument,
counts how many times each word appears in the file
and prints the word that appears the most and its count
"""

# I already built a similar program that takes a text document,
# strips the punctuation and numbers, stems the word,
# counts the number of occurences, and saves the results as a csv
# Since this is for my learning sake, I am not going to do it again
